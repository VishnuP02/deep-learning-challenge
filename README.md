Task: The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I used the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

Resources used to complete activity:
  - Lecture Slides, Class recordings, AskBCS session with Learning Assistant Sathwik Kesappragada


                                    Report on Neural Network Model Performance for Alphabet Soup

        Overview of the Analysis:

        The purpose of this analysis is to develop a deep learning model for Alphabet Soup that can predict whether applicants will be successful in
        receiving funding based on various features. The goal is to create an efficient classification model that aids in decision-making for allocating
        resources.
